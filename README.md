# sample-vendor
A sample vendor for the 'ork' repository.

This repo will house the code for an example vendor which uses the Tide network (more specifically, the ORKs in the 'ork' repo) to authenticate users. It will do this by integrating the heimdall SDK, which allows a vendor to quickly integrate Tide.

Things to do (as of 29/05/2023):
- Integrate heimdall with this vendor
- Figure out the flow and what this vendor will be able to do
- Should there be a vendor C# SDK too?
